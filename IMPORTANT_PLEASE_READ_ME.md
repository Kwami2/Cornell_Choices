#Rationale: The reason why I decided to do this mini project is because I want to be able to pratice using what I learned in python, and have the opportunity to apply what I learn as I go.
#Fact: The program will be constanlty expanding, but notconsistently due to school work and other commitments. However,I will try to have "CCmainbash.py" always working so the lastest version can be tested and played with.
#Fact: I know there are easier/ more efficenlty way to write my code, but I prefer to fully understand it before I use it. Hopefully over time, there will be a evolution of my code, as I learn more efficent way to write.
#Fact: In other words, I am writing this program to test my self.
